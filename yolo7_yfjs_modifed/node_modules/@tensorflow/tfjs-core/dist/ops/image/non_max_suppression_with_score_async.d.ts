/**
 * Asynchronously performs non maximum suppression of bounding boxes based on
 * iou (intersection over union).
 *
 * This op also supports a Soft-NMS mode (c.f.
 * Bodla et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503) where boxes reduce the score
 * of other overlapping boxes, therefore favoring different regions of the image
 * with high scores. To enable this Soft-NMS mode, set the `softNmsSigma`
 * parameter to be larger than 0.
 *
 * @param boxes a 2d tensor of shape `[numBoxes, 4]`. Each entry is
 *     `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`, where `(y1, x1)` and `(y2, x2)` are the corners of
 *     the bounding box.
 * @param scores a 1d tensor providing the box scores of shape `[numBoxes]`.
 * @param maxOutputSize The maximum number of boxes to be selected.
 * @param iouThreshold A float representing the threshold for deciding whether
 *     boxes overlap too much with respect to IOU. Must be between [0, 1].
 *     Defaults to 0.5 (50% box overlap).
 * @param scoreThreshold A threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based
 *     on score. Defaults to -inf, which means any score is accepted.
 * @param softNmsSigma A float representing the sigma parameter for Soft NMS.
 *     When sigma is 0, it falls back to nonMaxSuppression.
 * @return A map with the following properties:
 *     - selectedIndices: A 1D tensor with the selected box indices.
 *     - selectedScores: A 1D tensor with the corresponding scores for each
 *       selected box.
