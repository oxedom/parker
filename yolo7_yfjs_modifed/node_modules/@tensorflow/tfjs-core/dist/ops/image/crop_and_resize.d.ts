/**
 * Extracts crops from the input image tensor and resizes them using bilinear
 * sampling or nearest neighbor sampling (possibly with aspect ratio change)
 * to a common output size specified by cropSize.
 *
 * @param image 4d tensor of shape `[batch,imageHeight,imageWidth, depth]`,
 *     where imageHeight and imageWidth must be positive, specifying the
 *     batch of images from which to take crops
 * @param boxes 2d float32 tensor of shape `[numBoxes, 4]`. Each entry is
 *     `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`, where `(y1, x1)` and `(y2, x2)` are the normalized
 *     coordinates of the box in the boxInd[i]'th image in the batch
 * @param boxInd 1d int32 tensor of shape `[numBoxes]` with values in range
 *     `[0, batch)` that specifies the image that the `i`-th box refers to.
 * @param cropSize 1d int32 tensor of 2 elements `[cropHeigh, cropWidth]`
 *     specifying the size to which all crops are resized to.
 * @param method Optional string from `'bilinear' | 'nearest'`,
 *     defaults to bilinear, which specifies the sampling method for resizing
 * @param extrapolationValue A threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based
 *     on score. Defaults to 0.
 * @return A 4D tensor of the shape `[numBoxes,cropHeight,cropWidth,depth]`
