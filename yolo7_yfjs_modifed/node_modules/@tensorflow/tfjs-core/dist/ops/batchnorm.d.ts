/**
 * Batch normalization.
 *
 * As described in
 * [http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167).
 *
 * Mean, variance, scale, and offset can be of two shapes:
 *   - The same shape as the input.
 *   - In the common case, the depth dimension is the last dimension of x, so
 *     the values would be an `tf.Tensor1D` of shape [depth].
 *
 * Also available are stricter rank-specific methods with the same signature
 * as this method that assert that parameters passed are of given rank
 *   - `tf.batchNorm2d`
 *   - `tf.batchNorm3d`
 *   - `tf.batchNorm4d`
 *
 * @param x The input Tensor.
 * @param mean A mean Tensor.
 * @param variance A variance Tensor.
 * @param offset An offset Tensor.
 * @param scale A scale Tensor.
 * @param varianceEpsilon A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.
