/**
 * This operation reshapes the "batch" dimension 0 into `M + 1` dimensions of
 * shape `blockShape + [batch]`, interleaves these blocks back into the grid
 * defined by the spatial dimensions `[1, ..., M]`, to obtain a result with
 * the same rank as the input. The spatial dimensions of this intermediate
 * result are then optionally cropped according to `crops` to produce the
 * output. This is the reverse of `tf.spaceToBatchND`. See below for a precise
 * description.
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor4d([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 1, 1, 1]);
 * const blockShape = [2, 2];
 * const crops = [[0, 0], [0, 0]];
 *
 * x.batchToSpaceND(blockShape, crops).print();
 * ```
 *
 * @param x A `tf.Tensor`. N-D with `x.shape` = `[batch] + spatialShape +
 * remainingShape`, where spatialShape has `M` dimensions.
 * @param blockShape A 1-D array. Must have shape `[M]`, all values must
 * be >= 1.
 * @param crops A 2-D array.  Must have shape `[M, 2]`, all values must be >= 0.
 * `crops[i] = [cropStart, cropEnd]` specifies the amount to crop from input
 * dimension `i + 1`, which corresponds to spatial dimension `i`. It is required
 * that `cropStart[i] + cropEnd[i] <= blockShape[i] * inputShape[i + 1]`
 *
 * This operation is equivalent to the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Reshape `x` to `reshaped` of shape: `[blockShape[0], ...,
 * blockShape[M-1], batch / prod(blockShape), x.shape[1], ...,
 * x.shape[N-1]]`
 *
 * 2. Permute dimensions of `reshaped`to produce `permuted` of shape `[batch /
 * prod(blockShape),x.shape[1], blockShape[0], ..., x.shape[M],
 * blockShape[M-1],x.shape[M+1], ..., x.shape[N-1]]`
 *
 * 3. Reshape `permuted` to produce `reshapedPermuted` of shape `[batch /
 * prod(blockShape),x.shape[1] * blockShape[0], ..., x.shape[M] *
 * blockShape[M-1],x.shape[M+1], ..., x.shape[N-1]]`
 *
 * 4. Crop the start and end of dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of `reshapedPermuted`
 * according to `crops` to produce the output of shape: `[batch /
 * prod(blockShape),x.shape[1] * blockShape[0] - crops[0,0] - crops[0,1],
 * ..., x.shape[M] * blockShape[M-1] - crops[M-1,0] -
 * crops[M-1,1],x.shape[M+1], ..., x.shape[N-1]]`
