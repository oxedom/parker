/**
 * Construct a tensor by repeating it the number of times given by reps.
 *
 * This operation creates a new tensor by replicating `input` `reps`
 * times. The output tensor's i'th dimension has `input.shape[i] *
 * reps[i]` elements, and the values of `input` are replicated
 * `reps[i]` times along the i'th dimension. For example, tiling
 * `[a, b, c, d]` by `[2]` produces `[a, b, c, d, a, b, c, d]`.
 *
 * ```js
 * const a = tf.tensor1d([1, 2]);
 *
 * a.tile([2]).print();    // or a.tile([2])
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * const a = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);
 *
 * a.tile([1, 2]).print();  // or a.tile([1, 2])
 * ```
 * @param x The tensor to tile.
 * @param reps Determines the number of replications per dimension.
