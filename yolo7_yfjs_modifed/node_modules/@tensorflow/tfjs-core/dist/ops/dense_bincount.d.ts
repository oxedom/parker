/**
 * Outputs a vector with length `size` and the same dtype as `weights`.
 *
 * If `weights` are empty, then index `i` stores the number of times the value
 * `i` is counted in `x`. If `weights` are non-empty, then index `i` stores the
 * sum of the value in `weights` at each index where the corresponding value in
 * `x` is `i`.
 *
 * Values in `x` outside of the range [0, size) are ignored.
 *
 * @param x The input int tensor, rank 1 or rank 2.
 * @param weights The weights tensor, must have the same shape as x, or a
 *     length-0 Tensor, in which case it acts as all weights equal to 1.
 * @param size Non-negative integer.
 * @param binaryOutput Optional. Whether the kernel should count the appearance
 *     or number of occurrences. Defaults to False.
