/**
 * Creates an IOHandler that triggers file downloads from the browser.

 * const model = tf.sequential();
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense(
 *     {units: 1, inputShape: [10], activation: 'sigmoid'}));
 * const saveResult = await model.save('downloads://mymodel');

 * console.log(saveResult);
 * ```
 *
 * @param fileNamePrefix Prefix name of the files to be downloaded. For use with
 *   `tf.Model`, `fileNamePrefix` should follow either of the following two
 *   formats:
 *   1. `null` or `undefined`, in which case the default file
 *      names will be used:
 *      - 'model.json' for the JSON file containing the model topology and
 *        weights manifest.
 *      - 'model.weights.bin' for the binary file containing the binary weight
 *        values.
 *   2. A single string or an Array of a single string, as the file name prefix.
 *      For example, if `'foo'` is provided, the downloaded JSON
 *      file and binary weights file will be named 'foo.json' and
 *      'foo.weights.bin', respectively.
 * @param config Additional configuration for triggering downloads.
 * @returns An instance of `BrowserDownloads` `IOHandler`.

/**
 * Creates an IOHandler that loads model artifacts from user-selected files.
 *
 * This method can be used for loading from files such as user-selected files
 * in the browser.
 * When used in conjunction with `tf.loadLayersModel`, an instance of
 * `tf.LayersModel` (Keras-style) can be constructed from the loaded artifacts.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Note: This code snippet won't run properly without the actual file input
 * //   elements in the HTML DOM.
 *
 * // Suppose there are two HTML file input (`<input type="file" ...>`)
 * // elements.
 * const uploadJSONInput = document.getElementById('upload-json');
 * const uploadWeightsInput = document.getElementById('upload-weights');
 * const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(tf.io.browserFiles(
 *     [uploadJSONInput.files[0], uploadWeightsInput.files[0]]));
 * ```
 *
 * @param files `File`s to load from. Currently, this function supports only
 *   loading from files that contain Keras-style models (i.e., `tf.Model`s), for
 *   which an `Array` of `File`s is expected (in that order):
 *   - A JSON file containing the model topology and weight manifest.
 *   - Optionally, One or more binary files containing the binary weights.
 *     These files must have names that match the paths in the `weightsManifest`
 *     contained by the aforementioned JSON file, or errors will be thrown
 *     during loading. These weights files have the same format as the ones
 *     generated by `tensorflowjs_converter` that comes with the `tensorflowjs`
 *     Python PIP package. If no weights files are provided, only the model
 *     topology will be loaded from the JSON file above.
 * @returns An instance of `Files` `IOHandler`.
