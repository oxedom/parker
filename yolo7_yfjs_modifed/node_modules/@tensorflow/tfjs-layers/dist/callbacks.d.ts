 *
 * The following example based on fake data illustrates how this callback
 * can be used during `tf.LayersModel.fit()`:
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential();
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense({
 *   units: 3,
 *   activation: 'softmax',
 *   kernelInitializer: 'ones',
 *   inputShape: [2]
 * }));
 * const xs = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);
 * const ys = tf.tensor2d([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], [2, 3]);
 * const xsVal = tf.tensor2d([4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 2]);
 * const ysVal = tf.tensor2d([[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]], [2, 3]);
 * model.compile(
 *     {loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy', optimizer: 'sgd', metrics: ['acc']});
 *
 * // Without the EarlyStopping callback, the val_acc value would be:
 * //   0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, ...
 * // With val_acc being monitored, training should stop after the 2nd epoch.
 * const history = await model.fit(xs, ys, {
 *   epochs: 10,
 *   validationData: [xsVal, ysVal],
 *   callbacks: tf.callbacks.earlyStopping({monitor: 'val_acc'})
 * });
 *
 * // Expect to see a length-2 array.
 * console.log(history.history.val_acc);
 * ```

 *   heading: 'Callbacks',
